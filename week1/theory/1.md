# Graphs

## Oriented graph

graph with one connection

## DFS (_Depth-first search_)

go till the deepest node and then return back and repeat.

## BFS (_Breadth-first search_)

contains queue of nodes to go thru, for each step every neighbour of anode is gone through.

## Dijkstra

minimal path to node with BFS.

**All nodes are equal to `+Inf`, first one is `0` (put first to the queue)**
**While smth is in the queue:**

- Take `V` (node) from queue
- For each neighbor of `V - U`:
- If `U > V + edge(V, U)`, rewrite `U = V + (V, U)` and add `U` to the queue
